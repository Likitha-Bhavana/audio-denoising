# Audio Denoising using FFT and PSD (MATLAB)

This project contains a simple MATLAB script that performs audio denoising using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Power Spectral Density (PSD).

## 📁 Files

- `audio-denoising.m`: Main MATLAB script.
- `noisy.wav`: Sample noisy audio input.
- `denoised_output.wav`: Output generated after filtering.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the folder in MATLAB.
2. Make sure the audio file `sample_audio1.wav` is in the same directory.
3. Run `denoise_fft_psd.m` to:
   - Play original, noisy, and filtered audio
   - Display waveform and spectral plots
   - Save denoised audio as `denoised_output.wav`

## 🛠 Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- No extra toolboxes required

## 📌 Notes

This is a basic educational project for understanding simple denoising using FFT and PSD techniques.
